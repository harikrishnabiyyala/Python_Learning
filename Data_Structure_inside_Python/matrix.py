# another method and some more thing
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-using-2d-arrays-lists-the-right-way/   
# just go through the link
# arr= [0]*6   # 1D array
# print(arr)

# way to create 2D matrix
arr= [[0]*3]*6   # will make a 2D array where no of rows= 6
                    # and col= 3, not a good way to create like this if you will modify this matrix later
                
# OR
# arr= [[0 for i in range(cols)] for i in range(rows)]  
# note: use this way to create in case you will change the matrix ele value later
print(arr)

# method to acccess the each row in 2D array
for i in arr:

# accessing the row and col

# e.g: finding transpose of a matrix
matrix= [
    [1,2,3,4],
    [5,6,7,8],
    [9,10,11,12]
]

#logic: har ek row ka phla ele pick kar ke lst ke under rakhte jao
# transpose= []
# row= len(matrix)
# col= len(row)
# for i in range(col):  # 4: no of column
#     lst= []
#     for row in matrix:
#         lst.append(row[i])
#     transpose.append(lst)
# print(transpose)


# concise way of finding the transpose of a matrix
transposed= [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(col)]
print(transposed)

# OR
transpose= [[]]
for i in range(col):
    for j in range(row):
    transpose[i][j]= matrix[j][i]   # Definition of transpose


# accessing the ele of the matrix
# method 1:

matrix= [
    [1,2,3,4],
    [5,6,7,8],
    [9,10,11,12]
]
# here row=3,col=4
for row in matrix:   # will point to one of the row of matrix one by one
    # print(row)
    for i in row:   # will point to elements of particular row one by one
        print(i)


# method2- e.g: 
# reversing the each row of the given matrix   
# will work only when no of rows and col is known

# traverse each row of the matrix
# for i in range(3):   # as no of row in matrix= 3
#     start= 0
#     end= 4-1   # col-1
#     while start< end:   # we only have to go till mid-1 to reverse each array(row)
#         matrix[i][start],matrix[i][end]= matrix[i][end], matrix[i][start]
#         # now incr 'start' and decr 'end' to swap the next pair
#         start+= 1
#         end-= 1
# print(matrix)


# reversing a given matrix (ele of rows) when no of rows and col is known
# shortcut and best
reverse=[[row[-i] for i in range(1,len(row)+1)] for row in matrix]
print(reverse)

# reversing a given matrix when no of rows and col is known
# for row in matrix:
#     col= len(row)   # no of col is equal to the no of ele in each row
#     start,end= 0, col-1
#     while start< end:
#         row[start], row[end]= row[start], row[end]
#         start+= 1
#         end-= 1
# print(matrix)



# method to reverse only the row not the individual ele in the row
matrix.reverse()
print(matrix)
